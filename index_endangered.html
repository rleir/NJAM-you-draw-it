        The number of endangered species is rising yearly due to loss of native habitat
        and pollution.
      </p>
      <p>A species is assigned to one of these categories:
        <ul>
          <li>Not at risk -- A species that has been evaluated and found to be not at risk. </li>
          <li>Special concern -- A species of special concern because of characteristics
            that make it particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events. </li>
          <li>Threatened -- A species likely to become endangered if limiting factors
            are not reversed. </li>
          <li>Endangered (*) A species facing imminent extirpation or extinction. </li>
          <li>Extirpated -- A species no longer existing in the wild in Canada,
            but occurring elsewhere. </li>
          <li>Extinct -- A species that no longer exists. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p >
        Note:  The total number of species monitored by COSEWIC has also risen in this span
        of years, so the apparent trend might be considered overly alarming.
        We should keep in mind that this is not the proportion of species,
        but the absolute number. The following graphic makes this clearer.
